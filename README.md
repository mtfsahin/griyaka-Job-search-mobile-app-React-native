# griyaka project

In this project, we created an employment platform. To summarize, job candidates using the platform can apply to job postings, manage the candidate profile, and obtain special search results by filtering the postings. Employers, on the other hand, can open job postings, evaluate incoming job applications or send job offers to candidates they like. In addition, it can send messages to candidates and provide video calls. The results of the application (positive or negative) are sent to the evaluated candidates via SMS.

It has been developed using react native for both ios and android platforms. The data is pulled from the website via the REST API.
